<h1>Welcome to the SSN ACM 10th Year Anniversary Hackathon!</h1>
<p>We are excited to invite all students to participate in this event and showcase their skills and creativity.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This hackathon is different from traditional hackathons because we are not setting a specific theme. Instead, participants are allowed to choose any project that they believe will have an impact on society. We encourage participants to think creatively and focus on innovation while choosing their projects.</p>
<p>A few ideas to juice your thinking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GPTzero project: Develop an application that analyzes texts to determine whether they were generated by an AI.</li>
  <li>Traffic Management System: Design a real-time traffic management system that integrates with GPS and other traffic data sources to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion in urban areas.</li>
  <li>Sustainable Energy Management: Create a platform that utilizes data analytics and machine learning to optimize energy consumption in buildings and other facilities, reducing energy waste and promoting sustainability.</li>
  <li>Mental Health Support System: Develop a platform that uses AI and chatbots to provide mental health support and counseling to people suffering from stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues.</li>
  <li>Healthcare Analytics: Create a predictive model using machine learning algorithms that can detect potential diseases or health risks in patients by analyzing medical records and other health-related data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tracks</h2>

  <li>Creativity: How innovative and original is the idea?</li>
  <li>Feasibility: How practical and realistic is the project idea? Can it be implemented in real-world scenarios?</li>
  <li>Impact on Society: How much impact will the project have on society and how well does it address a societal issue?</li>
</ul>

<p>Our guest speaker, Madhavan Mukund from the Chennai Mathematical Institute, will evaluate the projects and announce the winners. We'll be evaluating the projects based on several criteria, as detailed in this <a href="rubric.md">rubric</a>.</p>
